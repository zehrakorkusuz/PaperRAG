(C) Scores for two topics derived from the latent Dirichlet allocation of ATAC features and their associated transcription factors. (D) Heatmap of eRegulon enrichment and expression across microglial clusters. (E) Perturbation simulation plots ablating Fos andNkfb2. Expression of the respective transcription factor was set to 0, and the gene regulatory networks were reinitialized to generate new expression profiles for each cell. Cells are projected in a PCA space defined by the gene regulatory net. Arrow shade indicates the magnitude of the transition flow. (F) Circos plot of the multiome dataset interactome. Size of the outermost bars represents the number of interactions, divided into cluster-by-other and other-bycluster.",
